# The Karters Modding Assistant SDK

This SDK has for purpose to speed up the mod making process for the _Prologue_ version of the game [The Karters 2: Turbo-Charged](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506950/The_Karters_2_Turbo_Charged__Prologue/) by bringing on the table useful wrappers and actions.

## Releases

Please check the [release page](https://github.com/The-Karters-Community/The-Karters-Modding-Assistant-SDK/releases) to find the lastest releases.

## Installation

Download and open the `.zip` archive to find a `TheKartersAssistant.dll` file. Uncompress it in the `/Steam/steamapps/common/The Karters 2 Turbo Charged - Prologue/BepInEx/plugins/` directory.

## Early testing nor development

You can test the current development of the SDK before it releases by building it yourself.

- Clone the repository on your local environment: `git clone https://github.com/The-Karters-Community/The-Karters-Modding-Assistant-SDK.git`
- Move to the new directory: `cd TheKartersModdingAssistant`
- Build the project with .NET: `dotnet build`

Then if you want to test, the `TheKartersModdingAssistant.dll` file will be generated in `/bin/Debug/net6.0/`. You can now copy and paste it to the game directory, see the [installation section](#installation).
